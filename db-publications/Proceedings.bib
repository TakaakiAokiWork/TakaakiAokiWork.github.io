abstract = {In analyzing a complex network in the real world, it is ideally of great help to recognize its universality class. While biological networks, in particular, grow under various ‘learning rules’, their impacts on scaling have not yet been characterized enough. Here we applied the Hodge-Kodaira decomposition, a topological method to count global loops, to neural networks with different learning rules and edge densities. Interestingly, the networks which evolved under different learning rules showed different scalings with edge densities. The causal learning rule scaled similarly to its underlying graph (i.e. Erdös-Renyi random graph, in this study), on which a network can grow, while the Hebbian-like rule did not.}

abstract = {Real-world networks are not static, but continuously change to meet the evolving needs of society. To manage and control such dynamic networks, we studied a simple model of co-evolving network dynamics, combining the dynamics of random walkers and the dynamics of weighted connections that are regulated by the traffic of the walkers. Under suitable conditions, the density of the walkers and the link weights converged to stationary power-law distributions at the macroscopic level. However, they continued to change with time at the microscopic level, even though the dynamics of the proposed model is completely deterministic. We numerically analyzed the equilibrium states from perspective of the dynamical system and found that the system has multi-stability including chaotic states.}

abstract = {In a recent paper, we proposed an evolutionary strategy for control and synchronization based on an extension of the Edge-Snapping method which was presented earlier in the literature. Here we show the generality of our methodology by applying it to a network of Rossler chaotic oscillators. Finally, we test the robustness properties of the evolutionary strategy, to variations of dynamical and control parameters.}
